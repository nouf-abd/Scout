## Project Structure

- **Android App**: All Android-related files and folders are designed to be opened with **Android Studio**. Simply open the project folder in Android Studio to start building or modifying the app.
  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The `.ipynb` file is meant to be opened in **Google Colab** for easy access to data analysis and model training features. Just upload it to Colab and run the cells in order.

## Getting Started
